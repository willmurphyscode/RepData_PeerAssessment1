## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(lubridate)
dat <- read.table(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"), sep=",", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dat$date <- ymd(dat$date)
head(dat)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
totalPerDay <- tapply(dat$steps, factor(dat$date), sum, na.rm = TRUE)
meanPerDay <- mean(totalPerDay)
medianPerDay <- median(totalPerDay)
hist(totalPerDay, main="Histogram for Total Steps Per Day", xlab="Number of Steps Taken", breaks = 10)

```

The mean total steps per day is `r meanPerDay` and the median total steps per day is `r medianPerDay`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
